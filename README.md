# Presentation-Website
Hello,
Thank you for reading this.
I made a responsive website, built from scratch using HTML5, CSS and JS.
The website I made has a responsive navbar made with js and the toggle button from the mobile view changes to an x when clicked on, and then changes back, also done with javascript.
I have included lots of hover styles and some elements that appear strictly on the mobile or web view.
I hope you like it.
Have a nice day and continue learning, it's fun!
